# Rhto-OxidativeStress
The use of cell factories to convert sugars from lignocellulosic biomass into chemicals in which oleochemicals and food additives, such as carotenoids, is essential for the shift towards sustainable processes. Rhodotorula toruloides is a yeast that naturally metabolises a wide range of substrates, including lignocellulosic hydrolysates, and converts them into lipids and carotenoids. In this study, xylose, the main component of hemicellulose, was used as the sole substrate for R. toruloides, and a detailed physiology characterisation combined with absolute proteomics and genome-scale metabolic models was carried out to understand the regulation of lipid and carotenoid production. To improve these productions, oxidative stress was induced by hydrogen peroxide and light irradiation and further enhanced by adaptive laboratory evolution. Based on the online measurements of growth and CO2 excretion, three distinct growth phases were identified during batch cultivations. The intracellular flux estimations demonstrated improved NADPH regeneration, phosphoketolase activity and reduced beta-oxidation, correlating with increasing lipid yield on biomass. Light irradiation resulted in 70% higher carotenoid and 40% higher lipid content. The presence of hydrogen peroxide did not affect the carotenoid production but culminated in the highest lipid content of 0.65 g/gDCW. The adapted strain showed improved fitness and 2.3-fold higher carotenoid yield on biomass than the parental strain. This work presented a holistic view of xylose conversion into microbial oil and carotenoids by R. toruloides for further cost-effective and renewable production of these molecules.
