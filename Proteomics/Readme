Absolute proteomics results for R. toruloides parental strain under the reference condition in three different growth phases (REF_ P1, P3, and SP) and light irradiation 
in phase 3 (LIG_P3); and for the R. toruloides the adapted strain under oxidative stress in phases 1 and 3 (ADA_P1, P3). Individual intensities for replicate experiments 
(s1-s3) and mean values for the measured conditions and mean absolute abundances (mg/g-protein) are provided.
